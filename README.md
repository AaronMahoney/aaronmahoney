## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a recent Software Engineering diploma graduate working hard to land my first role in the industry. While I'm new to the field, I bring over eight years of professional experience in media and broadcasting, where I developed a strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and an eye for detail.

Originally from St. John's, Newfoundland, I'm currently located in Calgary, Alberta. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always striving to improve my skills. Whether it's refining my code, exploring new technologies, or tackling complex problems, I'm always up for the challenge.

ðŸ’¡ What I'm Working On:

- Continuing to expand my skills in full-stack development

- Building projects to strengthen my portfolio

- Connecting with other developers and learning from the community
