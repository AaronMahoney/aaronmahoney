## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineering diploma graduate working hard to land my first role in the industry. While I'm new to the field, I bring over 8 years of professional experience in media and broadcasting, where I developed a strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and an eye for detail.

Originally from St. John's, Newfoundland, I now call Calgary, Alberta home. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always striving to improve my skills. Whether it's refining my code, exploring new technologies, or tackling complex problems, I'm always up for the challenge.

ðŸ’¡ What I'm Working On:

Expanding my skills in full-stack development

Building projects to strengthen my portfolio

Connecting with other developers and learning from the community
